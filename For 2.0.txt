* Make one large boulder image when some boulders are adjacent to each other in a certain way.

* Create levels and group them into bundles. Then like flow, players get mark A for completing a level perfect or mark B for regular completion. New bundles open once older ones finish. Should be different themes.

* Add more music (preferably for each level)

* Add an XML file for each tileset that would define the tiles and their types
